            <p>All tickets will be digital and accessible in the Utah Jazz + Vivint Arena App. Printed tickets will no longer be an option.

            <p>This move to digital-only has been made for several reasons:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li> - Helps to prevent fraudulent tickets from being circulated.</li>
                    <li> - Increases safety and security by providing an easier way to track whos using tickets and entering the arena.</li>
                    <li> - Allows for a convenient transfer processâ€”you can transfer your tickets with the touch of a button.</li>
                </ul>
